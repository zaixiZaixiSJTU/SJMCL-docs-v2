# Installing Mods

## Auto Install

The mod download interface is located within each instance. Go to the instance manager, select the instance you want to add mods to, switch to the **Mods** tab, and click the **Download Mods** button in the quick action bar on the right.

Search for and select the mod you want. Downloaded mods will be automatically added to the mod folder of the current instance.

SJMCL has built-in support for searching and downloading from `CurseForge` and `Modrinth`, with bilingual search support. If you can't find what you're looking for in your language, try searching in English.

You can click the external links for `CurseForge / Modrinth` in the top right corner to view detailed descriptions and reviews of a mod.

Click a specific version of a mod to download it. A popup will show all optional and required dependency mods — select them according to your current setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In general, download the version recommended by the launcher. If you choose a version manually, make sure it supports your game's loader type and version number.

> [!TIP]
> Worlds, resource packs, shader packs, and data packs can all be downloaded in a similar way.

## Manual Install

Most mod files have a `.jar` extension.

Copy the `.jar` file into `\.minecraft\versions\<version name>\Mods`.

If version isolation is manually disabled, the folder is `\.minecraft\Mods`.

Alternatively, you can add mods through SJMCL's **Game Management — Mod Management** page.

> [!TIP]
> Do not extract or unzip the mod's `.jar` file.

## Auto Update

SJMCL supports automatic checking and updating of installed mods. Click the **Check for Updates** button in the top right corner of the mod management page to check automatically.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to back up your game saves before updating mods, in case of compatibility issues.

## Game Crashes / Errors After Installing Mods

There are many reasons why a game may crash after installing mods, such as:

- **Mod version mismatch**: Make sure the mod version is compatible with your Minecraft version and loader version.
- **Mod conflicts**: Some mods may conflict with each other and cause crashes.
- **Missing dependencies**: Some mods require other mods as prerequisites.
- **Insufficient Java memory**: Mods increase the game's memory usage.

1. SJMCL has basic error analysis built in. For simple errors, follow the prompts provided by SJMCL.

   - **Update or downgrade mods**
     - Try updating to the latest version of the mod.
     - Or roll back to a previously stable version.
   - **Increase memory allocation**
     - Increase the Java memory allocated to the game in instance settings.
     - Allocating 4 GB or more is generally recommended.

2. For more complex errors, you can export the error report and consult an AI model (SJMCL has a built-in AI assistant [MiuChat](/en/docs/intelligence/miuchat)), or package the `\.minecraft\crash-reports` and `\.minecraft\logs` folders and share them with others for help.

3. For modpacks with many mods where conflicts are hard to identify, use the bisect method — add or remove half the mods at a time, restart the game, and narrow down until you find the culprit.

### Getting Help

If the issue persists:

- For launcher-related issues, report them on [SJMCL GitHub Issues](https://github.com/UNIkeEN/SJMCL/issues) or join our [User Community](/en/docs/user-group).
- Check the mod's official documentation or community forums.
- Seek help from the Minecraft community.

> [!TIP]
> Please do not submit a GitHub issue for general game launch errors unrelated to the launcher.
