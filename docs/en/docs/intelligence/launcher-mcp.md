# Launcher MCP Service

> [!NOTE]
> The screenshots in the documentation are from the Chinese interface. The launcher already includes English and other language translations, and the documentation will be updated later.

You can enable the Launcher MCP service so external Agent applications can automate control of the launcher.

## Configure the Launcher

Before configuring an external Agent app, first enable the service port in the launcher.

1. Open the launcher **Settings** page.
2. Go to the **Intelligence** tab.
3. Enable **Launcher MCP Service**.
4. **Critical step**: write down the port number shown on the page (default `18970` in the screenshot below).
   > **Note**: Keep the launcher running. The MCP service currently works only while the launcher is running.

### Configure Cherry Studio (Windows Example)

Cherry Studio natively supports HTTP (SSE) mode, and setup is straightforward.

#### Step 1: Add a Global MCP Server

1. Open Cherry Studio and click **Settings** (gear icon) in the lower-left corner.
2. Select **MCP Servers** from the left menu.
3. Click **+ Add** in the upper-right corner.
4. Choose **Quick Create**.

5. Fill in the following fields in the popup:

   | Option | How to fill | Example |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | **Name** | Custom service name | `SJMCL` |
   | **Type** | Must be this option | `Streamable HTTP (streamableHTTP)` |
   | **URL** | Format: `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/mcp` | `http://127.0.0.1:18970/mcp` |

   > **Tip**: Replace `18970` in the URL with the actual port shown in your launcher settings.

6. Click **Save**.
7. **Check status**: after saving, confirm the switch in the list is **green (enabled)** and the status indicator is lit, which means the connection is established successfully.

#### Step 2: Enable Tools in an Assistant

After adding the server, you still need to grant the assistant permission to use it.

1. Return to the **main chat page** (the first speech-bubble icon in the sidebar).
2. Select the **default assistant** on the left (or another assistant you created).
3. Click **More options** (three-dot icon) next to the assistant name to open settings.
4. **Model check**: ensure a usable model is selected in “Model Settings” ([Cherry Studio model setup guide](https://docs.cherry-ai.com/pre-basic/providers)).
5. Scroll down to **MCP Servers**.
6. Enable **Manual mode**, find the `SJMCL` service you just added, and toggle it **on**.

#### Step 3: Verify and Use

You can now send commands in chat to test whether the AI can successfully invoke launcher functions.
